I'm interested in database systems and research topics in storage systems, and I'm actively exploring trending topics. I hate to take on the dirty work of writing a personal website as I have a terrible aesthetic sense. If you'd like to get in touch with me, please feel free to drop me an email (I prefer written communication as I believe writing prompts one to take time to phrase things they want to say carefully rather than throw clueless garbage).
