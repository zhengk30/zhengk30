I am interested in computer systems in general, with a particular focus on high-performance data processing systems, especially where networking and storage systems meet. Currently, I am exploring emerging hardware resources and applying them to achieve better performance and scalability for large-scale data processing systems. If you'd like to get in touch with me, please feel free to drop me an email (I prefer written communication as I believe writing prompts one to take time to phrase things they want to say carefully rather than throw clueless garbage).
