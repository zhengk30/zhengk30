I'm interested in database systems and research topics in storage systems, and I'm actively exploring trending topics. I hate to take on the dirty work of writing a personal website as I have a terrible aesthetic sense. If you want to get in touch with me, feel free to drop me an email (I prefer written communication as I sincerely believe that writing prompts one to ponder carefully about what they want to say before saying anything).
